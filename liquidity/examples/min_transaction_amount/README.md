This contract checks that an incoming amount of tz is above a certain amount before accepting the amount.  

In this contract the storage is *the minimum amount of tz the contract will accept*.  The parameter is *unit*.

To verify that the script only let transfers that are above or equal to the specified amount to go through:

(1) compile the min_transaction_amount.liq to .tz (by running **liquidity min_transaction_amount.liq**)

(2) typecheck the script with 

**tezos-client typecheck script [path to]/min_transaction_amount.tz**

(3) run the tezos-client with the *run script* command.  Here is an excerpt of the command details from [this link](https://tezos.gitlab.io/alphanet/api/cli-commands.html#client-manual):

-----------------------------------------------------

run script ***src*** on storage ***storage*** and input ***storage*** [--trace-stack] [--amount <amount>] [-q --no-print-source]  

Ask the node to run a script.  

***src***: source script  
  Can be a script name, a file or a raw script literal. If the parameter is
  not the name of an existing script, the client will look for a file
  containing a script, and if it does not exist, the argument will be read as
  a raw script.  
  Use 'alias:name', 'file:path' or 'text:literal' to disable autodetect.  
***storage***: the storage data  
***storage***: the input data  
**--trace-stack**: show the stack after each step  
**--amount <amount>**: amount of the transfer in êœ©  
  Defaults to `0.05`.  
**-q --no-print-source**: don't print the source code  
  If an error is encountered, the client will print the contract's source
  code by default.  
  This option disables this behaviour.  

-------------------------------------------------------

The storage or input data have to be in a specific format.  See [this](https://github.com/cryptiumlabs/smarter-contracts/blob/master/liquidity/examples/tezos-clients-data-format.md).

For this contract, the *storage data* is the storage, i.e., the minimum amount it is going to accept.  The *input data* is the parameter of the contract, which is unit.  The *storage data* you pass in has to be an integer.  The integer represents 1/1000000 of 1tz.  That is, 1tz in the liquidity language translates to 1000000 in the *storage data* parameter.  However, the **--amount** option you pass in is in tz!    

If this contract works properly, a transfer can only go through if the transfer amount (passed in with the --amount option) is greater than the storage data.

You can see the script working, with the specified amount of 10tz, by passing in an amount above and below 10 tz respectively:

### When transfer amount is higher than the required amount

**tezos-client run script [path to]/min_transaction_amount.tz on storage '10000000' and input Unit --trace-stack --amount '11.0'**  

The **--trace-stack** option shows the stack operations.  The tezos-client ran the script without problem, because 11tz is larger than 10 tz.  The output:

### When transfer amount is lower than the required amount.

**tezos-client run script [path to]/min_transaction_amount.tz on storage '10000000' and input Unit --trace-stack --amount '9.00'**  

Because the transfer amount is less than the required amount, a runtime error occur as desired.  The output:
